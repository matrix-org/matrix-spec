Feature: Update profile endpoints to become generic to support [MSC4133](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4133) extended fields. Extended profile fields are now supported via the new `m.profile_fields` capability. Stabilised keys are explicitly enumerated, and custom keys must conform to the Common Namespaced Identifier Grammar.
