title: Room Version 10
type: docs
weight: 100
---

This room version builds on [version 9](/rooms/v9) to enforce that power level
values be integers, and to introduce a new `knock_restricted` join rule, allowing
prospective members to more easily join such a room.

## Client considerations

This room version adds a new `knock_restricted` join rule to allow prospective
members of a room join either through knocking (introduced in [room version 7](/rooms/v7))
or through "join restrictions" (introduced in [room version 8](/rooms/v8) and
refined in [room version 9](/rooms/v9)).

Clients should render the new join rule accordingly for such rooms.

Clients which implement the redaction algorithm locally should refer to the
[redactions](#redactions) section below for a full overview.

[Room version 7](/rooms/v7) added "knocking" and [room version 8](/rooms/v8)
added "join restrictions" (refined by [room version 9](/rooms/v9)) - both allow
prospective members an avenue to join, however both could not be used at the
same time due to how the join rules work. This room version adds a new
`knock_restricted` join rule as a mix of the two behaviours (first match wins).

This room version additionally requires that values in the power levels event
be integers and not string representations, unlike other room versions.

Room version 10 is based upon room version 9 with the following considerations.
