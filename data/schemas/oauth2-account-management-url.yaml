title: OAuth 2.0 Account Management URL Query Parameters
properties:
  action:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The action that the user wishes to take. Must match one of the actions advertised by the
      server in [`account_management_actions_supported`](/client-server-api/#account-management-url-discovery).
  device_id:
    type: string
    description: |-
      For Matrix-specific actions, the user's device ID. Actions which don't support the device ID
      will ignore it.

      If the `org.matrix.device_view` or `org.matrix.device_delete` actions are advertised as
      supported by the server then the server SHOULD support the `device_id` parameter.
