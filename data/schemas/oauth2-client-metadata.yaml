title: OAuthClientMetadata
type: object
description: |-
  This definition of the metadata specifies only the fields that are meaningful
  in the context of the Matrix specification. All the possible values are
  registered in the [OAuth Dynamic Client Registration Metadata registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata),
  and normative definitions of them are available in their respective RFCs.
properties:
  client_uri:
    type: string
    format: uri
    description: |-
      A URL to a valid web page that SHOULD give the user more information about
      the client.

      This URL MUST use the `https` scheme and SHOULD NOT require authentication
      to access. It MUST NOT use a user or password in the authority component
      of the URI.

      The server MAY reject client registrations if this field is invalid or
      missing.

      This URI is a common base for all the other URIs in the metadata: those
      MUST be either on the same host or on a subdomain of the host of the
      `client_uri`. The port number, path and query components MAY be different.

      For example, if the `client_uri` is `https://example.com/`, then one of
      the `redirect_uris` can be `https://example.com/callback` or
      `https://app.example.com/callback`, but not `https://app.com/callback`.
  client_name:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Human-readable name of the client to be presented to the user.

      This field can be [localized](/client-server-api/#metadata-localization).
  logo_uri:
    type: string
    format: uri
    description: |-
      URL that references a logo for the client.

      This URL MUST use the `https` scheme.

      This field can be [localized](/client-server-api/#metadata-localization).
  tos_uri:
    type: string
    format: uri
    description: |-
      URL that points to a human-readable terms of service document for the
      client.

      This URL MUST use the `https` scheme and SHOULD NOT require authentication
      to access. It MUST NOT use a user or password in the authority component
      of the URI.

      If this field is set, the server SHOULD show or link to this URL.

      This field can be [localized](/client-server-api/#metadata-localization).
  policy_uri:
    type: string
    format: uri
    description: |-
      URL that points to a human-readable policy document for the client.

      This URL MUST use the `https` scheme and SHOULD NOT require authentication
      to access. It MUST NOT use a user or password in the authority component
      of the URI.

      If this field is set, the server SHOULD show or link to this URL.

      This field can be [localized](/client-server-api/#metadata-localization).
  redirect_uris:
    type: array
    description: |-
      Array of redirection URIs for use in redirect-based flows.

      At least one URI is required to use the authorization code grant.

      The server MUST perform [validation on redirect URIs](/client-server-api/#redirect-uri-validation).
    items:
      type: string
      format: uri
      description: A redirection URI.
  response_types:
    type: array
    description: |-
      Array of the OAuth 2.0 response types that the client may use.

      This MUST include the `code` value to use the authorization code grant.

      The server MUST ignore values that it does not understand.
    items:
      type: string
      description: A response type that the client may use.
  grant_types:
    type: array
    description: |-
      Array of the OAuth 2.0 grant types that the client may use.

      This MUST include:
      - the `authorization_code` value to use the authorization code grant,
      - the `refresh_token` value to use the refresh token grant.

      The server MUST ignore values that it does not understand.
    items:
      type: string
      description: A grant type that the client may use.
  token_endpoint_auth_method:
    type: string
    description: |-
      String indicator of the requested authentication method for the token
      endpoint.

      The homeserver MUST support the `none` value, as most Matrix clients are
      client-side only, do not have a server component, and therefore are public
      clients.
  application_type:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Kind of the application.

      The homeserver MUST support the `web` and `native` values to be able to
      perform [redirect URI validation](/client-server-api/#redirect-uri-validation).

      Defaults to `web` if omitted.
required:
  - client_uri
