description: |-
  This event type is used to exchange keys for end-to-end encryption.
  It is encrypted as an `m.room.encrypted` event using [Olm](#molmv1curve25519-aes-sha2),
  then sent as a [to-device](/client-server-api/#send-to-device-messaging) event.

          Whether the key may be forwarded to users who join the room after the
          messages encrypted with this key have been sent.  Defaults to
          `false`.

          This can be set to `true` if the history visibility settings of the
          room allow users to read events in the room from before they have
          joined, that is, if the `m.room.history_visibility` state event is
          `"world_readable"` or `"shared"`. For more information, see [Key
          requests and forwarding](#key-requests-and-forwarding).
