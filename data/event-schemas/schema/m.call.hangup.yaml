  Sent by either party to signal their termination of the call. This can
  be sent either once the call has has been established or before to abort the call.

  The meanings of the `reason` field are as follows:
   * `ice_failed`: ICE negotiation has failed and a media connection could not be established.
   * `ice_timeout`: The connection failed after some media was exchanged (as opposed to `ice_failed`
      which means no media connection could be established). Note that, in the case of an ICE
      renegotiation, a client should be sure to send `ice_timeout` rather than `ice_failed` if media
      had previously been received successfully, even if the ICE renegotiation itself failed.
   * `invite_timeout`: The other party did not answer in time.
   * `user_hangup`: Clients must now send this code when the user chooses to end the call, although
     for backwards compatibility with version 0, a clients should treat an absence of the `reason`
     field as `user_hangup`.
   * `user_media_failed`: The client was unable to start capturing media in such a way that it is unable
     to continue the call.
   * `user_busy`: The user is busy. Note that this exists primarily for bridging to other networks such
      as the PSTN. A Matrix client that receives a call whilst already in a call would not generally reject
      the new call unless the user had specifically chosen to do so.
   * `unknown_error`: Some other failure occurred that meant the client was unable to continue the call
      rather than the user choosing to end it.
