  Indicates a reaction to a previous event.

  Has no defined `content` properties of its own. Its only purpose is to hold an
  [`m.relates_to`](/client-server-api/#definition-mrelates_to) property.

  Since they contain no content other than `m.relates_to`, `m.reaction` events
  are normally not encrypted, as there would be no benefit in doing so.

              The reaction being made, usually an emoji.

              If this is an emoji, it should include the unicode emoji
              presentation selector (`\uFE0F`) for codepoints which allow it
              (see the [emoji variation sequences
              list](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/emoji/emoji-variation-sequences.txt)).
