                Previously this field was required, however given it offers no additional
                security or privacy benefit it has been deprecated. See [`m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2`](#mmegolmv1aes-sha2)
                for more information.

              The Curve25519 key of the device which initiated the session originally.

              **Deprecated**: This field provides no additional security or privacy benefit
              and must not be read from. It should still be included on outgoing messages
              (if the event for which keys are being requested for *also* has a `sender_key`),
              however must not be used to find the corresponding session. See [`m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2`](#mmegolmv1aes-sha2)
              for more information.
