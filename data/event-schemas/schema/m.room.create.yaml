          The `user_id` of the room creator. **Required** for, and only present in, room versions 1 - 10. Starting with
          room version 11 the event `sender` should be used instead.

          Optional [room type](/client-server-api/#types) to denote a room's intended function outside of traditional
          conversation.

          Unspecified room types are possible using [Namespaced Identifiers](/appendices/#common-namespaced-identifier-grammar).

                This field became deprecated and may not be present in all cases. It SHOULD still
                be populated where possible/practical. Previously, it was required.
            description: |-
              The event ID of the last known event in the old room, if known.

              If not set, clients SHOULD search for the `m.room.tombstone` state event to navigate to
              when directing the user to the old room (potentially after joining the room, if requested
              by the user).

        description: |-
          Starting with room version 12, the other user IDs to consider as creators for the room in
          addition to the `sender` of this event. Each string MUST be a valid [user ID](/appendices#user-identifiers)
          for the room version.

          When not present or empty, the `sender` of the event is the only creator.

          In room versions 1 through 11, this field serves no purpose and is not validated. Clients
          SHOULD NOT attempt to parse or understand this field in these room versions.

          **Note**: Because `creator` was removed in room version 11, the field is not used to determine
          which user(s) are room creators in room version 12 and beyond either.
