description: |-
  Sent by a client to share a secret with another device, in response to an
  `m.secret.request` event. It must be encrypted as an `m.room.encrypted` event
  using [Olm](/client-server-api/#molmv1curve25519-aes-sha2), then sent as a
  to-device event.

  The `request_id` must match the ID previously given in an `m.secret.request`
  event. The recipient must ensure that this event comes from a device that the
  `m.secret.request` event was originally sent to, and that the device is
  a verified device owned by the recipient. This should be done by checking the
  sender key of the Olm session that the event was sent over.
