    A topic is a short message detailing what is currently being discussed in the room.
    It can also be used as a way to display extra information about the room, which may not
    be suitable for the room name.
    The room topic can also be set when creating a room using `/createRoom` with the `topic` key.'
    
    If a room has an `m.room.topic` event with an absent, null, or empty `topic`
    field, it should be treated the same as a room with no `m.room.topic` event.
