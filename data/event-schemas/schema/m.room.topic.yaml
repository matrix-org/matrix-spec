  A topic is a short message detailing what is currently being discussed
  in the room.  It can also be used as a way to display extra information
  about the room, which may not be suitable for the room name. The room
  topic can be set when creating a room using
  [`/createRoom`](client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3createroom), either
  with the `topic` key or by specifying a full event in `initial_state`.
  
  In order to prevent formatting abuse in room topics, clients SHOULD
  limit the length of topics during both entry and display, for instance,
  by capping the number of displayed lines. Additionally, clients SHOULD
  ignore things like headings and enumerations (or format them as regular
  text).
