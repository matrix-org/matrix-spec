description: |-
  This event type is used when sending encrypted events. It can be used either
  within a room (in which case it will have all of the [Room Event fields](/client-server-api/#room-event-fields)), or
  as a [to-device](/client-server-api/#send-to-device-messaging) event.

          Curve25519 identity key to ciphertext information, in the case of an
          Olm event. For more details, see [Messaging Algorithms](/client-server-api/#messaging-algorithms).

            Previously this field was required, however given it offers no additional
            security or privacy benefit it has been deprecated for Megolm messages.

          The Curve25519 key of the sender. Required (not deprecated) if not using Megolm.

          **Deprecated**: This field provides no additional security or privacy benefit
          for Megolm messages and must not be read from if the encrypted event is using
          Megolm. It should still be included on outgoing messages, however must not be
          used to find the corresponding session. See [`m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2`](#mmegolmv1aes-sha2)
