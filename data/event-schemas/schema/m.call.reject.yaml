  If the `m.call.invite` event has `version` `"1"`, a client wishing to
  reject the call sends an `m.call.reject` event. This rejects the call on all devices,
  but if the calling device sees an `answer` before the `reject`, it disregards the
  reject event and carries on. The reject has a `party_id` just like an answer, and
  the caller sends a `select_answer` for it just like an answer. If another client
  had already sent an answer and sees the caller select the reject response instead
  of its answer, it ends the call. If the `m.call.invite` event has `version` `0`,
  the callee sends an `m.call.hangup` event. If the calling user chooses to end the
  call before setup is complete, the client sends `m.call.hangup` as previously.

  Note that, unlike `m.call.hangup`, this event has no `reason` field: the rejection of
  a call is always implicitly because the user chose not to answer it.
