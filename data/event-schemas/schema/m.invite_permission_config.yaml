              When set to `block`, the user does not wish to receive *any* room invites, and they
              should be rejected automatically by the homeserver.

              A missing, invalid or unsupported value means that the user wants to receive invites
              as normal. Other parts of the specification might still have effects on invites, like
              [ignoring users](/client-server-api/#ignoring-users).
