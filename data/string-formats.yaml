# This file contains the list of string formats supported for the `format` key
# and the `x-pattern-format` extension within JSON Schema objects in the
# OpenAPI documents within the Matrix Specification. See
# `openapi_extensions.md` [1] for more details.
#
# [1]: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/blob/main/openapi_extensions.md#custom-x-pattern-format-key-and-custom-formats
#
# Custom formats defined in the Matrix specification should always use the `mx-`
# prefix. They should link to the section containing the definition of the
# format in the spec.
#
# Formats that are already supported in the JSON Schema specification should
# link to the RFC where they are defined, and should not use a regex to allow
# tools that recognize the format to validate it properly.
# See <https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string#built-in-formats>.
#
# All entries have the form:
#
# key:
#   title: The title rendered in the specification
#   url: /url/to#definition
#   # regex: A regex that can be used to validate the custom format if possible.
#            It should be used as the `pattern` of the string.
