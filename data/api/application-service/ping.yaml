      summary: Ping the application service
      description: |-
        This API is called by the homeserver to ensure that the connection works
        and the `hs_token` the homeserver has is correct.

        Currently this is only called by the homeserver as a direct result of
        the application service calling
        [`POST /_matrix/client/v1/appservice/{appserviceId}/ping`](#post_matrixclientv1appserviceappserviceidping).
