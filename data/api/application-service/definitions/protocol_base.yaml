  user_fields:
    description: |-
      Fields which may be used to identify a third-party user. These should be
      ordered to suggest the way that entities may be grouped, where higher
      groupings are ordered first. For example, the name of a network should be
      searched before the nickname of a user.

      type: string

    description: |-
      Fields which may be used to identify a third-party location. These should be
      ordered to suggest the way that entities may be grouped, where higher
      groupings are ordered first. For example, the name of a network should be
      searched before the name of a channel.

      The type definitions for the fields defined in `user_fields` and
      `location_fields`. Each entry in those arrays MUST have an entry here.
      The `string` key for this object is the field name itself.

      May be an empty object if no fields are defined.

            A regular expression for validation of a field's value. This may be relatively
            coarse to verify the value as the application service providing this protocol
            may apply additional validation or filtering.
