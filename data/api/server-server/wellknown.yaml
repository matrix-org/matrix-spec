      summary: Gets information about the delegated server for server-server
        communication.
      description: |-
        Gets information about the delegated server for server-server communication
        between Matrix homeservers. Servers should follow 30x redirects, carefully
        avoiding redirect loops, and use normal X.509 certificate validation.

      responses:
        "200":
          description: The delegated server information. The `Content-Type` for this
            response SHOULD be `application/json`, however servers parsing the
            response should assume that the body is JSON regardless of type.
            Failures parsing the JSON or invalid data provided in the resulting
            parsed JSON should not result in discovery failure - consult the
            server discovery process for information on how to continue.

                      The server name to delegate server-server communications to, with optional
                      port. The delegated server name uses the same grammar as
                      [server names in the appendices](/appendices/#server-name).
