      summary: Lists the server's published room directory

        Lists the server's published room directory.

        This API returns paginated responses. The rooms are ordered by the number
        of joined members, with the largest rooms first.

        This SHOULD not return rooms that are listed on another homeserver's directory,
        just those listed on the receiving homeserver's directory.

                    A pagination token from a previous request, allowing servers
                    to get the next (or previous) batch of rooms.  The direction
                    of pagination is specified solely by which token is supplied,
                    rather than via an explicit flag.

                        An optional string to search for in the room metadata, e.g. name,

                        for. To include rooms without a room type, specify `null` within this
                        list. When not specified, all applicable rooms (regardless of type)
                        are returned.

                    Whether or not to include all known networks/protocols from

                    The specific third-party network/protocol to request from the
                    homeserver. Can only be used if `include_all_networks` is false.

                    This is the `instance_id` of a `Protocol Instance` returned by
                    [`GET /_matrix/client/v3/thirdparty/protocols`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3thirdpartyprotocols).
