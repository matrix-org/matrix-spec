      summary: Claims one-time encryption keys for a user.
      description: |-
        Claims one-time keys for use in pre-key messages.

        The request contains the user ID, device ID and algorithm name of the
        keys that are required. If a key matching these requirements can be
        found, the response contains it. The returned key is a one-time key
        if one is available, and otherwise a fallback key.

        One-time keys are given out in the order that they were uploaded via
        [/keys/upload](/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3keysupload). (All
        keys uploaded within a given call to `/keys/upload` are considered
        equivalent in this regard; no ordering is specified within them.)

        Servers must ensure that each one-time key is returned at most once,
        so when a key has been returned, no other request will ever return
        the same key.
