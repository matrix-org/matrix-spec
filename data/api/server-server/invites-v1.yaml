      summary: Invites a remote user to a room
      description: |-
        Invites a remote user to a room. Once the event has been signed by both the inviting
        homeserver and the invited homeserver, it can be sent to all of the servers in the
        room by the inviting homeserver.

        Servers should prefer to use the v2 API for invites instead of the v1 API. Servers
        which receive a v1 invite request must assume that the room version is either `"1"`
        or `"2"`.

        Note that events have a different format depending on the room version - check the
        [room version specification](/rooms) for precise event formats. **The request and response
        bodies here describe the common event fields in more detail and may be missing other
        required fields for a PDU.**

        Also note that if the remote homeserver is already in the room, it will receive the
        invite event twice; once through this endpoint, and again through a [federation
        transaction](/server-server-api/#transactions).

        Servers MUST apply certain validation to ensure they don't accidentally sign non-invite
        events from a malicious server. The `M_MISSING_PARAM` error code is used to indicate one
        or more of the following:

        * The invite event fails a [signature check](/server-server-api/#validating-hashes-and-signatures-on-received-events).
        * The event type is not `m.room.member`.
        * The `membership` field inside the event content is not `invite`.
        * The event sender is not a user ID on the origin server.
        * The `state_key` is not a user ID on the receiving server.

        The `M_MISSING_PARAM` error code is also used to indicate one or more of the following
        problems in the `invite_room_state` field:

        * The `m.room.create` event is missing from `invite_room_state`.
        * One or more entries in `invite_room_state` are not formatted according
          to the room's version.
        * One or more events fails a [signature check](/server-server-api/#validating-hashes-and-signatures-on-received-events).
        * One or more events does not reside in the same room as the invite.
          Note: Some room versions may require calculating the room ID for an
          event rather than relying on the presence of `room_id`.

        Servers MAY apply the `invite_room_state` validation to room versions 1 through 11,
        and SHOULD apply the validation to all other room versions.
