title: Unsigned Persistent Data Unit
description: An unsigned persistent data unit (event)
example:
  $ref: "../examples/unsigned_pdu_base.json"
properties:
  room_id:
    type: string
    description: Room identifier.
    example: "!abc123:matrix.org"
  sender:
    type: string
    description: The ID of the user sending the event.
    example: "@someone:matrix.org"
  origin_server_ts:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    description: Timestamp in milliseconds on origin homeserver when this event was created.
    example: 1234567890
  type:
    type: string
    description: Event type
    example: "m.room.message"
  state_key:
    type: string
    description: |-
      If this key is present, the event is a state event, and it will replace previous events
      with the same `type` and `state_key` in the room state.
    example: "my_key"
  content:
    type: object
    description: The content of the event.
    example: {"key": "value"}
  prev_events:
    type: array
    description: |-
      Event IDs and reference hashes for the most recent events in the room
      that the homeserver was aware of when it made this event.

      Must contain less than or equal to 20 events.
    items:
      type: array
      maxItems: 2
      minItems: 2
      items:
        anyOf:

            example: "$abc123:matrix.org"
          - $ref: "event_hash.yaml"
  depth:
    type: integer
    description: |-
      The maximum depth of the `prev_events`, plus one. Must be less than the
      maximum value for an integer (2^63 - 1). If the room's depth is already at
      the limit, the depth must be set to the limit.
    example: 12
  auth_events:
    type: array
    description: |-
      Event IDs and reference hashes for the authorization events that would
      allow this event to be in the room.

      Must contain less than or equal to 10 events. Note that if the relevant
      auth event selection rules are used, this restriction should never be
      encountered.
    items:
      type: array
      maxItems: 2
      minItems: 2
      items:

  unsigned:
    type: object
    title: UnsignedData
