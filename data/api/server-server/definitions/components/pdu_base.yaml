    type: string
    description: The ID of the user sending the event.
    example: "@someone:matrix.org"
  origin_server_ts:

    description: Timestamp in milliseconds on origin homeserver when this event was created.
    example: 1234567890
  type:
    type: string
    description: Event type
    example: "m.room.message"
  state_key:
    type: string
    description: |-
      If this key is present, the event is a state event, and it will replace previous events

    description: The content of the event.
    example: {"key": "value"}
  depth:
    type: integer
    description: |-
      The maximum depth of the `prev_events`, plus one. Must be less than the
      maximum value for an integer (2^63 - 1). If the room's depth is already at
      the limit, the depth must be set to the limit.
    example: 12
  hashes:
    $ref: "event_hash.yaml"
  signatures:
    type: object
    description: |-
      Signatures for the PDU, following the algorithm specified in [Signing Events](/server-server-api/#signing-events).
    example: {
      "example.com": {
