  title: Matrix Client-Server events in room by date API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  "/rooms/{roomId}/timestamp_to_event":
    get:
      x-addedInMatrixVersion: "1.6"
      summary: Get the closest event ID to the given timestamp
      description: |-
        Get the ID of the event closest to the given timestamp, in the
        direction specified by the `dir` parameter.

        If the server does not have all of the room history and does not have
        an event suitably close to the requested timestamp, it can use the
        corresponding [federation endpoint](/server-server-api/#get_matrixfederationv1timestamp_to_eventroomid)
        to ask other servers for a suitable event.

        After calling this endpoint, clients can call
        [`/rooms/{roomId}/context/{eventId}`](#get_matrixclientv3roomsroomidcontexteventid)
        to obtain a pagination token to retrieve the events around the returned event.

        The event returned by this endpoint could be an event that the client
        cannot render, and so may need to paginate in order to locate an event
        that it can display, which may end up being outside of the client's
        suitable range.  Clients can employ different strategies to display
        something reasonable to the user.  For example, the client could try
        paginating in one direction for a while, while looking at the
        timestamps of the events that it is paginating through, and if it
        exceeds a certain difference from the target timestamp, it can try
        paginating in the opposite direction.  The client could also simply
        paginate in one direction and inform the user that the closest event
        found in that direction is outside of the expected range.

                      `event_id` fetched is too far out of range to be useful for your
                      use case.
