      summary: Retrieve a portion of a space tree.
      description: |-
        Paginates over the space tree in a depth-first manner to locate child rooms of a given space.

        Where a child room is unknown to the local server, federation is used to fill in the details.
        The servers listed in the `via` array should be contacted to attempt to fill in missing rooms.

        Only [`m.space.child`](#mspacechild) state events of the room are considered. Invalid child
        rooms and parent events are not covered by this endpoint.

          name: suggested_only
          description: |-
            Optional (default `false`) flag to indicate whether or not the server should only consider
            suggested rooms. Suggested rooms are annotated in their [`m.space.child`](#mspacechild) event
            contents.
          example: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
        - in: query
          name: limit
          description: |-
            Optional limit for the maximum number of rooms to include per response. Must be an integer
            greater than zero.

            Servers should apply a default value, and impose a maximum value to avoid resource exhaustion.
          example: 20
          schema:
            type: integer
        - in: query
          name: max_depth
          description: |-
            Optional limit for how far to go into the space. Must be a non-negative integer.

            When reached, no further child rooms will be returned.

            Servers should apply a default value, and impose a maximum value to avoid resource exhaustion.
          example: 5
          schema:

        - in: query
