      x-changedInMatrixVersion:
        "1.16": This endpoint now accepts a variable `keyName` parameter and `m.tz` was added as a defined key. Previously only `displayname` and `avatar_url` were accepted.
      summary: Set a profile field for a user.
      description: |-
        Set or update a profile field for a user. Must be authenticated with an
        access token authorised to make changes. Servers MAY impose size limits
        on individual fields, and the total profile MUST be under 64 KiB.

        Servers MAY reject `null` values. Servers that accept `null` values SHOULD store
        them rather than treating `null` as a deletion request. Clients that want to delete a
        field, including its key and value, SHOULD use the `DELETE` endpoint instead.

        This endpoint uses [capabilities negotiation](/client-server-api/#capabilities-negotiation)
        depending on the `keyName`.
        For the `displayname` key, clients SHOULD check the value of the [`m.set_displayname` capability](/client-server-api/#mset_displayname-capability).
        For the `avatar_url` key, clients SHOULD check the value of the [`m.set_avatar_url` capability](/client-server-api/#mset_avatar_url-capability).

                For `displayname`, the value MUST be a string.
                
                For `m.tz`, the value MUST be a valid identifier from the  [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).
                Servers MAY choose to validate the value. Clients MUST expect unknown or invalid
                values.

                For custom keys, any JSON type is allowed. Servers MAY not validate
                these values, but clients SHOULD follow the format defined for that key.
