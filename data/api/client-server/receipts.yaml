            The type of receipt to send. This can also be `m.fully_read` as an
            alternative to [`/read_markers`](/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidread_markers).

            Note that `m.fully_read` does not appear under `m.receipt`: this endpoint
            effectively calls `/read_markers` internally when presented with a receipt
            type of `m.fully_read`.
          required: true
          x-changedInMatrixVersion:
            "1.4": |
              Allow `m.read.private` receipts and `m.fully_read` markers to be set.
          example: m.read
          schema:
            type: string
            enum:
              - m.read

              - m.fully_read

                    The root thread event's ID (or `main`) for which
                    thread this receipt is intended to be under. If
                    not specified, the read receipt is *unthreaded*
                    (default).

                "thread_id": "main"

            The `thread_id` is invalid in some way. For example:
            * It is not a string.
            * It is empty.
            * It is provided for an incompatible receipt type.
            * The `event_id` is not related to the `thread_id`.
