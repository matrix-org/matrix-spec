            The type of receipt to send. This can also be `m.fully_read` as an
            alternative to [`/read_markers`](/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidread_markers).

            Note that `m.fully_read` does not appear under `m.receipt`: this endpoint
            effectively calls `/read_markers` internally when presented with a receipt
            type of `m.fully_read`.

                    (default).

            The `thread_id` is invalid in some way. For example:
            * It is not a string.
            * It is empty.
            * It is provided for an incompatible receipt type.
            * The `event_id` is not related to the `thread_id`.
