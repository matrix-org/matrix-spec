      summary: |-
        Ask the homeserver to ping the application service to ensure the connection works.
      description: |-
        This API asks the homeserver to call the `/_matrix/app/v1/ping` endpoint
        on the application service to ensure that the homeserver can communicate
        with the application service.

        This API requires the use of an application service access token (`as_token`)
        instead of a typical client's access_token. This API cannot be invoked by
        users who are not identified as application services. Additionally, the
        appservice ID in the path must be the same as the appservice whose `as_token`
        is being used.

        - in: path

            The appservice ID of the appservice to ping. This must be the same
            as the appservice whose `as_token` is being used to authenticate the
            request.
