  title: Matrix Client-Server Application Service Ping API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  "/appservice/{appserviceId}/ping":
    post:
      x-addedInMatrixVersion: "1.7"
      summary: Ask the homeserver to ping the application service to ensure the
        connection works.
      description: |-
        This API asks the homeserver to call the
        [`/_matrix/app/v1/ping`](#post_matrixappv1ping) endpoint on the
        application service to ensure that the homeserver can communicate
        with the application service.

        This API requires the use of an application service access token (`as_token`)
        instead of a typical client's access token. This API cannot be invoked by
        users who are not identified as application services. Additionally, the
        appservice ID in the path must be the same as the appservice whose `as_token`
        is being used.
      operationId: pingAppservice
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: appserviceId
          description: |-
            The appservice ID of the appservice to ping. This must be the same
            as the appservice whose `as_token` is being used to authenticate the
            request.
