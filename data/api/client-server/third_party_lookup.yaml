        Requesting this endpoint with a valid protocol name results in a list
        of successful mapping results in a JSON array. Each result contains
        objects to represent the Matrix room or rooms that represent a portal
        to this third-party network. Each has the Matrix room alias string,
        an identifier for the particular third-party network protocol, and an
        object containing the network-specific fields that comprise this
        identifier. It should attempt to canonicalise the identifier as much
        as reasonably possible given the network type.
