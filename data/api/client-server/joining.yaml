      summary: Start the requesting user participating in a particular room.
      description: |-
        *Note that this API requires a room ID, not alias.*
        `/join/{roomIdOrAlias}` *exists if you have a room alias.*

        This API starts a user participating in a particular room, if that user
        is allowed to participate in that room. After this call, the client is
        allowed to see all current state events in the room, and all subsequent
        events associated with the room until the user leaves the room.

        After a user has joined a room, the room will appear as an entry in the
        response of the [`/initialSync`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3initialsync)
        and [`/sync`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync) APIs.

              This parameter has been deprecated in favour of `via` and will be removed in
              a future version of the spec.

              Clients SHOULD use `via` when the homeserver they're talking to supports it.
              To do this, they MAY either detect server support through the supported spec
              versions in [`/_matrix/client/versions`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientversions)
              or always include both parameters with identical values.

              Homeservers MUST ignore all `server_name` parameters if any `via` parameters
              are supplied.
