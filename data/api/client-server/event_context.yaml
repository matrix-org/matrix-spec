  title: Matrix Client-Server Event Context API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  "/rooms/{roomId}/context/{eventId}":
    get:
      summary: Get events and state around the specified event.
      description: |-
        This API returns a number of events that happened just before and
        after the specified event. This allows clients to get the context
        surrounding an event.

        *Note*: This endpoint supports lazy-loading of room member events. See
        [Lazy-loading room members](/client-server-api/#lazy-loading-room-members) for more information.

      parameters:
        - in: path

          description: The room to get events from.
          required: true

          required: true

          schema:
            type: string
        - in: query
          name: limit
          description: |-
            The maximum number of context events to return. The limit applies
            to the sum of the `events_before` and `events_after` arrays. The
            requested event ID is always returned in `event` even if `limit` is
            0. Defaults to 10.
          example: 3
          schema:
            type: integer
        - in: query
          name: filter
          description: |-
            A JSON `RoomEventFilter` to filter the returned events with. The
            filter is only applied to `events_before`, `events_after`, and
            `state`. It is not applied to the `event` itself. The filter may
            be applied before or/and after the `limit` parameter - whichever the
            homeserver prefers.

            See [Filtering](/client-server-api/#filtering) for more information.
