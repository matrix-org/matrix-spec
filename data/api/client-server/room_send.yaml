      summary: Send a message event to the given room.
      description: |-
        This endpoint is used to send a message event to a room. Message events
        allow access to historical events and pagination, making them suited
        for "once-off" activity in a room.

        The body of the request should be the content object of the event; the
        fields in this object will vary depending on the type of event. See
        [Room Events](/client-server-api/#room-events) for the m. event specification.

            The [transaction ID](/client-server-api/#transaction-identifiers) for this event. Clients should generate an
            ID unique across requests with the same access token; it will be
            used by the server to ensure idempotency of requests.

            The request is invalid. A [standard error response](/client-server-api/#standard-error-response)
            will be returned. As well as the normal common error codes, other reasons for rejection include:

            - `M_DUPLICATE_ANNOTATION`: The request is an attempt to send a [duplicate annotation](/client-server-api/#avoiding-duplicate-annotations).
