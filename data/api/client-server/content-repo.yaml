      summary: Create a new `mxc://` URI without uploading the content.
      description: |-
        Creates a new `mxc://` URI, independently of the content being uploaded. The content must be provided later
        via [`PUT /_matrix/media/v3/upload/{serverName}/{mediaId}`](/client-server-api/#put_matrixmediav3uploadservernamemediaid).

        The server may optionally enforce a maximum age for unused IDs,
        and delete media IDs when the client doesn't start the upload in time,
        or when the upload was interrupted and not resumed in time. The server
        should include the maximum POSIX millisecond timestamp to complete the
        upload in the `unused_expires_at` field in the response JSON. The
        recommended default expiration is 24 hours which should be enough time
        to accommodate users on poor connection who find a better connection to
        complete the upload.

        As well as limiting the rate of requests to create `mxc://` URIs, the server
        should limit the number of concurrent *pending media uploads* a given
        user can have. A pending media upload is a created `mxc://` URI where (a)
        the media has not yet been uploaded, and (b) has not yet expired (the
        `unused_expires_at` timestamp has not yet passed). In both cases, the
        server should respond with an HTTP 429 error with an errcode of
        `M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

            Indicates preference for an animated thumbnail from the server, if possible. Animated
            thumbnails typically use the content types `image/gif`, `image/png` (with APNG format),
            `image/apng`, and `image/webp` instead of the common static `image/png` or `image/jpeg`
            content types.

            When `true`, the server SHOULD return an animated thumbnail if possible and supported.
            When `false`, the server MUST NOT return an animated thumbnail. For example, returning a
            static `image/png` or `image/jpeg` thumbnail. When not provided, the server SHOULD NOT
            return an animated thumbnail.

            Servers SHOULD prefer to return `image/webp` thumbnails when supporting animation.

            When `true` and the media cannot be animated, such as in the case of a JPEG or PDF, the
            server SHOULD behave as though `animated` is `false`.

        being shared should also not be shared with the homeserver.

        repository, such as upload limitations.

        All values are intentionally left optional. Clients SHOULD follow

        **NOTE:** Both clients and server administrators should be aware that proxies
        between the client and the server may affect the apparent behaviour of content
        repository APIs, for example, proxies may enforce a lower upload size limit
        than is advertised by the server on this endpoint.

        The server MUST return a `Content-Type` which is either exactly the same
        as the original upload, or reasonably close. The bounds of "reasonable"
        are:

        * Adding a charset to `text/*` content types.
        * Detecting HTML and using `text/html` instead of `text/plain`.
        * Using `application/octet-stream` when the server determines the
          content type is obviously wrong. For example, an encrypted file being
          claimed as `image/png`.
        * Returning `application/octet-stream` when the media has an
          unknown/unprovided `Content-Type`. For example, being uploaded before
          the server tracked content types or when the remote server is
          non-compliantly omitting the header entirely.
        
        Actions not in the spirit of the above are not considered "reasonable".
