      summary: Create a new `mxc://` URI without uploading the content.
      description: |-
        Creates a new `mxc://` URI, independently of the content being uploaded. The content must be provided later
        via [`PUT /_matrix/media/v3/upload/{serverName}/{mediaId}`](/client-server-api/#put_matrixmediav3uploadservernamemediaid).

        The server may optionally enforce a maximum age for unused IDs,
        and delete media IDs when the client doesn't start the upload in time,
        or when the upload was interrupted and not resumed in time. The server
        should include the maximum POSIX millisecond timestamp to complete the
        upload in the `unused_expires_at` field in the response JSON. The
        recommended default expiration is 24 hours which should be enough time
        to accommodate users on poor connection who find a better connection to
        complete the upload.

        As well as limiting the rate of requests to create `mxc://` URIs, the server
        should limit the number of concurrent *pending media uploads* a given
        user can have. A pending media upload is a created `mxc://` URI where (a)
        the media has not yet been uploaded, and (b) has not yet expired (the
        `unused_expires_at` timestamp has not yet passed). In both cases, the
        server should respond with an HTTP 429 error with an errcode of
        `M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.
