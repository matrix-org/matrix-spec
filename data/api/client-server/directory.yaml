        room aliases can only be deleted by their creator or a server administrator.

        **Note:**
        Servers may choose to update the `alt_aliases` for the `m.room.canonical_alias`
        state event in the room when an alias is removed. Servers which choose to update the
        canonical alias event are recommended to, in addition to their other relevant permission
        checks, delete the alias and return a successful response even if the user does not
        have permission to update the `m.room.canonical_alias` event.

        This endpoint can be called by users who are in the room (external
        users receive an `M_FORBIDDEN` error response). If the room's
        `m.room.history_visibility` maps to `world_readable`, any
        user can call this endpoint.

        Servers may choose to implement additional access control checks here,
        such as allowing server administrators to view aliases regardless of
        membership.

        **Note:**
        Clients are recommended not to display this list of aliases prominently
        as they are not curated, unlike those listed in the `m.room.canonical_alias`
        state event.
