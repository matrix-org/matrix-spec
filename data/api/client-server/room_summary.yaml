  title: Matrix Client-Server Room Summary API

paths:
  "/room_summary/{roomIdOrAlias}":
    get:

      summary: Retrieves a summary for a room.
      description: |-
        Retrieves a summary for a room.

        Clients should note that requests for rooms where the user's membership
        is `invite` or `knock` might yield outdated, partial or even no data
        since the server may not have access to the current state of the room.

        Servers MAY allow unauthenticated access to this API if at least one of
        the following conditions holds true:

        - The room has a [join rule](#mroomjoin_rules) of `public`, `knock` or
          `knock_restricted`.
        - The room has a `world_readable` [history visibility](#room-history-visibility).

        Servers should consider rate limiting requests that require a federation request more heavily if the client is unauthenticated.
