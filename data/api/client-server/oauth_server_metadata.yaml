      summary: Get the OAuth 2.0 authorization server metadata.
      description: |-
        Gets the OAuth 2.0 authorization server metadata, as defined in
        [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414), including the
        endpoint URLs and the supported parameters that can be used by the
        clients.

        This endpoint definition includes only the fields that are meaningful in
        the context of the Matrix specification. The full list of possible
        fields is available in the [OAuth Authorization Server Metadata
        registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#authorization-server-metadata),
        and normative definitions of them are available in their respective
        RFCs.

        {{% boxes/note %}}
        The authorization server metadata is relatively large and may change
        over time. Clients should:

        - Cache the metadata appropriately based on HTTP caching headers
        - Refetch the metadata if it is stale
