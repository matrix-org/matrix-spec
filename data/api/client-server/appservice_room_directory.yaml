  title: Matrix Client-Server Application Service Room Directory API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  "/directory/list/appservice/{networkId}/{roomId}":
    put:
      summary: Updates a room's visibility in the application service's room directory.
      description: |-
        Updates the visibility of a given room on the application service's room
        directory.

        This API is similar to the room directory visibility API used by clients
        to update the homeserver's more general room directory.

        This API requires the use of an application service access token (`as_token`)
        instead of a typical client's access_token. This API cannot be invoked by
        users who are not identified as application services.
      operationId: updateAppserviceRoomDirectoryVisibility
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: networkId
          description: |-
            The protocol (network) ID to update the room list for. This would
            have been provided by the application service as being listed as
            a supported protocol.
          required: true
          example: irc
          schema:
            type: string
        - in: path
          name: roomId
          description: The room ID to add to the directory.

                  description: |-
                    Whether the room should be visible (public) in the directory
                    or not (private).
                  example: public
              required:
                - visibility
        required: true
