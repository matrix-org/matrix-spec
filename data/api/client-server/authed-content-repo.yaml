            Indicates preference for an animated thumbnail from the server, if possible. Animated
            thumbnails typically use the content types `image/gif`, `image/png` (with APNG format),
            `image/apng`, and `image/webp` instead of the common static `image/png` or `image/jpeg`
            content types.

            When `true`, the server SHOULD return an animated thumbnail if possible and supported.
            When `false`, the server MUST NOT return an animated thumbnail. For example, returning a
            static `image/png` or `image/jpeg` thumbnail. When not provided, the server SHOULD NOT
            return an animated thumbnail.

            Servers SHOULD prefer to return `image/webp` thumbnails when supporting animation.

            When `true` and the media cannot be animated, such as in the case of a JPEG or PDF, the
            server should behave as though `animated` is `false`.
