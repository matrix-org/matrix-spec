  title: Matrix Client-Server Threads List API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  "/rooms/{roomId}/threads":
    get:
      x-addedInMatrixVersion: "1.4"
      summary: Fetches a list of the threads in a room.
      description: |-
        This API is used to paginate through the list of the thread roots in a given room. 

        Optionally, the returned list may be filtered according to whether the requesting
        user has participated in the thread.
      operationId: getThreadRoots
      security:
        - accessToken: []
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: roomId
          description: The room ID where the thread roots are located.
          required: true
          example: "!room:example.org"
          schema:
            type: string
        - in: query
          name: include
          description: |-
            Optional (default `all`) flag to denote which thread roots are of interest to the caller.
            When `all`, all thread roots found in the room are returned. When `participated`, only
            thread roots for threads the user has [participated in](/client-server-api/#server-side-aggregation-of-mthread-relationships)
            will be returned.
          example: all
          schema:
            type: string
            enum:
              - all
              - participated
        - in: query
          name: limit
          description: |-
            Optional limit for the maximum number of thread roots to include per response. Must be an integer
            greater than zero.

            Servers should apply a default value, and impose a maximum value to avoid resource exhaustion.
          example: 20
          schema:
            type: integer
        - in: query
          name: from
          description: |-
            A pagination token from a previous result. When not provided, the server starts paginating from
            the most recent event visible to the user (as per history visibility rules; topologically).
          example: next_batch_token
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: A portion of the available thread roots in the room, based on the
            filter criteria.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  chunk:
                    type: array
                    description: |-
                      The thread roots, ordered by the `latest_event` in each event's aggregated children. All events
                      returned include bundled [aggregations](/client-server-api/#aggregations-of-child-events).

                      If the thread root event was sent by an [ignored user](/client-server-api/#ignoring-users), the
                      event is returned redacted to the caller. This is to simulate the same behaviour of a client doing
                      aggregation locally on the thread.

                    type: string
                    description: |-
                      A token to supply to `from` to keep paginating the responses. Not present when there are
                      no further results.

            The request was invalid in some way. A meaningful `errcode`
            and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection are:

            - The `from` token is unknown to the server.

          description: |-
            The user cannot view or peek on the room. A meaningful `errcode`
            and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection are:

            - The room is not set up for peeking.
            - The user has been banned from the room.
            - The room does not exist.
