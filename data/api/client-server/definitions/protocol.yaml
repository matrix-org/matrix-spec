      description: |-
        A list of objects representing independent instances of configuration.
        For example, multiple networks on IRC if multiple are provided by the
        same application service.

        The instances are modified by the homeserver from the response of
        [`GET /_matrix/app/v1/thirdparty/protocol/{protocol}`](/application-service-api/#get_matrixappv1thirdpartyprotocolprotocol)
        to include an `instance_id` to serve as a unique identifier for each
        instance on the homeserver.

                  A unique identifier for this instance on the homeserver. This field is added
                  to the response of [`GET /_matrix/app/v1/thirdparty/protocol/{protocol}`](/application-service-api/#get_matrixappv1thirdpartyprotocolprotocol)
                  by the homeserver.
                  
                  This is the identifier to use as the `third_party_instance_id` in a request to
                  [`POST /_matrix/client/v3/publicRooms`](/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3publicrooms).
