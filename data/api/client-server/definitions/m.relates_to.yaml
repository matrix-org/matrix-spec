title: m.relates_to
description: |-
  Describes the relationship of an event to its parent. This is contained
  within the event's `content` alongside other fields for the relevant event type.
example: {
  # We deliberately "break" the example by including the top-level field so it renders
  # sensibly for readers of the spec.

  rel_type:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The namespaced relationship type. Values must use the
      [Common Namespaced Identifier Grammar](/appendices/#common-namespaced-identifier-grammar).

      The relationship type determines how clients should perceive the event, and in what
      context. Some relationship types are processed server-side for "bundling", though not
      all relationships require such behaviour. For example, an `m.thread` relationship type
      might denote that the event is part of a "thread" of messages and should be rendered as
      such.
  event_id:
    type: string
    description: The event ID of the event that this event relates to.
required: ['rel_type', 'event_id']
