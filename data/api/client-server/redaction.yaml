      description: |-
        Strips all information out of an event which isn't critical to the
        integrity of the server-side representation of the room.

        This cannot be undone.

        Any user with a power level greater than or equal to the `m.room.redaction`
        event power level may send redaction events in the room. If the user's power
        level greater is also greater than or equal to the `redact` power level
        of the room, the user may redact events sent by other users.

        Server administrators may redact events sent by users on their server.
