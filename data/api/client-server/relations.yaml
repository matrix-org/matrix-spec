      summary: Get the child events for a given parent event.
      description: |-
        Retrieve all of the child events for a given parent event.

        Note that when paginating the `from` token must be *before* the `to` token, if
        supplied. This means it's only possible to paginate "forwards" through events.
        An example of an *invalid* call would be a `from` token from page 2 of the results,
        and a `to` token from page 1: the server can't go backwards with this information.
        The caller can use a `from` token from page 1 and a `to` token from page 2 to
        paginate forwards over the same range, however.

            The [relationship type](/client-server-api/#relationship-types) to search
            for, if any. Exclude to find all child events which point to the supposed parent
            event with any `rel_type`.

            The event type of child events to search for, if any. Exclude to find all
            child events of any type which point to the supposed parent event.

            Note that in encrypted rooms this will typically always be `m.room.encrypted`
            regardless of the event type contained within the encrypted payload.
          required: true # we can't say false, annoyingly

        - in: query
          type: string
          name: from
          description: |-
            The pagination token to start returning results from. If not supplied, results
            start at the earliest topological event known to the server.

            Can be a `next_batch` or `prev_batch` token from a previous call, or a returned
            `start`/`end` token from [`/messages`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3roomsroomidmessages)
            or `next_batch`/`prev_batch` token from [`/sync`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync).

        - in: query
          type: string
          name: to
          description: |-
            The pagination token to stop returning results at. If not supplied, results
            continue up to `limit` or until there are no more events.

            Like `from`, this can be a previous token from a prior call to this endpoint
            or from `/messages` or `/sync`.
          required: false
          x-example: "page3_token"
        - in: query
          type: integer
          name: limit
          description: |-
            The maximum number of results to return in a single `chunk`. The server can
            and should apply a maximum value to this parameter to avoid large responses.

            Similarly, the server should apply a default value when not supplied.
          required: false
          x-example: 20
      responses:
        # note: this endpoint deliberately does not support rate limiting, therefore a
        # 429 error response is not included.

          description: |-
            The paginated child events which point to the parent. If no events are
            pointing to the parent or the pagination yields no results, an empty `chunk`
            is returned.

                  An opaque string representing a pagination token. The absence of this token
