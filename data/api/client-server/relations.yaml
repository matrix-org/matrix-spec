      summary: Get the child events for a given parent event, with optional filter.
      description: |-
        Retrieve all of the child events for a given parent event, optionally filtering
        down by relationship type and related event type.

        Note that while this endpoint indicates `relType` and `eventType` being
        required, they can be individually omitted to retrieve all matching events.
        When omitting the path parameters, a trailing slash must not be included
        (otherwise the search will be for an empty string).

        When combining the use of `relType` and `eventType`, the server will return
        child events which match *both* conditions rather than *either*.

            The [relationship type](/client-server-api/#relationship-types) to search
            for, if any. Exclude to find all child events which point to the supposed parent
            event with any `rel_type`.

            The event type of child events to search for, if any. Exclude to find all
            child events of any type which point to the supposed parent event.

            Note that in encrypted rooms this will typically always be `m.room.encrypted`
            regardless of the event type contained within the encrypted payload.

          type: string

          description: |-
            The pagination token to start returning results from. If not supplied, results
            start at the earliest topological event known to the server.

            Can be a `next_batch` or `prev_batch` token from a previous call, or an equivalent
            token from [`/messages`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3roomsroomidmessages)
            or [`/sync`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync) to limit results to the
            events returned by that section of timeline.
          required: false
          x-example: "page2_token"
        - in: query
          type: string
          name: to
          description: |-
            The pagination token to stop returning results at. If not supplied, results
            continue up to `limit` or until there are no more events.

            Like `from`, this can be a previous token from a prior call to this endpoint
            or from `/messages` or `/sync` to limit to a section of timeline.
          required: false
          x-example: "page3_token"
        - in: query
          type: integer
          name: limit
          description: |-
            The maximum number of results to return in a single `chunk`. The server can
            and should apply a maximum value to this parameter to avoid large responses.

            Similarly, the server should apply a default value when not supplied.
          required: false
          x-example: 20
      responses:
        # note: this endpoint deliberately does not support rate limiting, therefore a
        # 429 error response is not included.

          description: |-
            The paginated child events which point to the supposed parent. If no events are
            pointing to the parent, an empty `chunk` is returned.

                description: |-
                  An opaque string representing a pagination token. The absence of this token
                  means there are no more results to fetch and the client should stop paginating.
              prev_batch:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  An opaque string representing a pagination token. The absence of this token
                  means there are no prior results to fetch, i.e. this is the first batch.
