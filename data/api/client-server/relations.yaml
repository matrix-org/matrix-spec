        Retrieve all of the child events for a given parent event.

        Note that when paginating the `from` token should be "after" the `to` token in
        terms of topological ordering, because it is only possible to paginate "backwards"
        through events, starting at `from`.

        For example, passing a `from` token from page 2 of the results, and a `to` token
        from page 1, would return the empty set. The caller can use a `from` token from
        page 1 and a `to` token from page 2 to paginate over the same range, however.
