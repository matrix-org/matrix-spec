        Gets server admin contact and support page of the domain.

        Like the [well-known discovery URI](/client-server-api/#well-known-uri),
        this should be accessed with the hostname of the homeserver by making a
        GET request to `https://hostname/.well-known/matrix/support`.

        Note that this endpoint is not necessarily handled by the homeserver.
        It may be served by another webserver, used for discovering support
        information for the homeserver.

                      Ways to contact the server administrator.

                      At least one of `contacts` or `support_page` is required.
                      If only `contacts` is set, it must contain at least one
                      item.

                            representing the administrator.

                            It could be an account registered on a different
                            homeserver so the administrator can be contacted
                            when the homeserver is down.

                            At least one of `matrix_id` or `email_address` is
                            required.
                        email_address:

                            An email address to reach the administrator.

                            At least one of `matrix_id` or `email_address` is

                            are used for.

                            `m.role.admin` is a catch-all role for any queries
                            and `m.role.security` is intended for sensitive
                            requests.

                            Unspecified roles are permitted through the use of
                            [Namespaced Identifiers](/appendices/#common-namespaced-identifier-grammar).
