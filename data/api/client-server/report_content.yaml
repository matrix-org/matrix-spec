      summary: Report an event in a joined room as inappropriate.
      description: |-
        Reports an event as inappropriate to the server, which may then notify
        the appropriate people. The caller must be joined to the room to report
        it.
        
        It might be possible for clients to deduce whether an event exists by
        timing the response, as only a report for an event that does exist
        will require the homeserver to check whether a user is joined to
        the room. To combat this, homeserver implementations should add
        a random delay when generating a response.
