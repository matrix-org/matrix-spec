        Gets information about the owner of a given access token.

        Note that, as with the rest of the Client-Server API,
        Application Services may masquerade as users within their
        namespace by giving a `user_id` query parameter. In this
        situation, the server should verify that the given `user_id`
        is registered by the appservice, and return it in the response
        body.

                      is associated with the access token (such as in the case
                      of application services) then this field can be omitted.
                      Otherwise this is required.

                      When `true`, the user is a [Guest User](/client-server-api/#guest-access).
                      When not present or `false`, the user is presumed to be a 
                      non-guest user.
