        Deactivate the user's account, removing all ability for the user to
        login again.

        This API endpoint uses the [User-Interactive Authentication API](/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api).

        An access token should be submitted to this endpoint if the client has
        an active session.

        The homeserver may change the flows available depending on whether a
        valid access token is provided.

        Unlike other endpoints, this endpoint does not take an `id_access_token`
        parameter because the homeserver is expected to sign the request to the
        identity server instead.

                    The identity server to unbind all of the user's 3PIDs from.
                    If not provided, the homeserver MUST use the `id_server`
                    that was originally use to bind each identifier. If the
                    homeserver does not know which `id_server` that was,
                    it must return an `id_server_unbind_result` of
                    `no-support`.
                  example: example.org
                erase:
                  x-addedInMatrixVersion: "1.10"

                  description: |-
                    Whether the user would like their content to be erased as
                    much as possible from the server.

                    Erasure means that any users (or servers) which join the
                    room after the erasure request are served redacted copies of
                    the events sent by this account. Users which had visibility
                    on those events prior to the erasure are still able to see
                    unredacted copies. No redactions are sent and the erasure
                    request is not shared over federation, so other servers
                    might still serve unredacted copies.

                    The server should additionally erase any non-event data
                    associated with the user, such as [account data](/client-server-api/#client-config)
                    and [contact 3PIDs](/client-server-api/#adding-account-administrative-contact-information).

                    Defaults to `false` if not present.

                      An indicator as to whether or not the homeserver was able to unbind
                      the user's 3PIDs from the identity server(s). `success` indicates
                      that all identifiers have been unbound from the identity server while
                      `no-support` indicates that one or more identifiers failed to unbind
                      due to the identity server refusing the request or the homeserver
                      being unable to determine an identity server to unbind from. This
                      must be `success` if the homeserver has no identifiers to unbind
                      for the user.
