        Changes the password for an account on this homeserver.

        This API endpoint uses the [User-Interactive Authentication API](/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api) to
        ensure the user changing the password is actually the owner of the
        account.

        An access token should be submitted to this endpoint if the client has
        an active session.

        The homeserver may change the flows available depending on whether a
        valid access token is provided. The homeserver SHOULD NOT revoke the
        access token provided in the request. Whether other access tokens for
        the user are revoked depends on the request parameters.

                    Whether the user's other access tokens, and their associated devices, should be
                    revoked if the request succeeds. Defaults to true.

                    When `false`, the server can still take advantage of the [soft logout method](/client-server-api/#soft-logout)
                    for the user's remaining devices.
