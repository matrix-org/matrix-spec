      summary: Invite a user to participate in a particular room.
      description: |-
        *Note that there are two forms of this API, which are documented separately.
        This version of the API requires that the inviter knows the Matrix
        identifier of the invitee. The other is documented in the
        [third-party invites](/client-server-api/#third-party-invites) section.*

        This API invites a user to participate in a particular room.
        They do not start participating in the room until they actually join the
        room.

        Only users currently in a particular room can invite other users to
        join that room.

        If the user was invited to the room, the homeserver will append a
        `m.room.member` event to the room.

            The request is invalid. A meaningful `errcode` and description
            error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection include:

            - The request body is malformed (`errcode` set to `M_BAD_JSON`
              or `M_NOT_JSON`).

            - One or more users being invited to the room are residents of a
              homeserver which does not support the requested room version. The
              `errcode` will be `M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION` in these cases.

            You do not have permission to invite the user to the room. A meaningful `errcode` and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejections are:

            - The invitee has been banned from the room.
            - The invitee is already a member of the room.
            - The inviter is not currently in the room.
            - The inviter's power level is insufficient to invite users to the room.
