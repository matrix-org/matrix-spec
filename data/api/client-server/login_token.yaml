      summary: Optional endpoint to generate a single-use, time-limited,
        `m.login.token` token.
      description: |-
        Optional endpoint - the server is not required to implement this endpoint if it does not
        intend to use or support this functionality.

        This API endpoint uses the [User-Interactive Authentication API](/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api).

        An already-authenticated client can call this endpoint to generate a single-use, time-limited,
        token for an unauthenticated client to log in with, becoming logged in as the same user which
        called this endpoint. The unauthenticated client uses the generated token in a `m.login.token`
        login flow with the homeserver.

        Clients, both authenticated and unauthenticated, might wish to hide user interface which exposes
        this feature if the server is not offering it. Authenticated clients can check for support on
        a per-user basis with the `m.get_login_token` [capability](/client-server-api/#capabilities-negotiation),
        while unauthenticated clients can detect server support by looking for an `m.login.token` login
        flow with `get_login_token: true` on [`GET /login`](/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3login).

        In v1.7 of the specification, transmission of the generated token to an unauthenticated client is
        left as an implementation detail. Future MSCs such as [MSC3906](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3906)
        might standarise a way to transmit the token between clients.

        The generated token MUST only be valid for a single login, enforced by the server. Clients which
        intend to log in multiple devices must generate a token for each.

        With other User-Interactive Authentication (UIA)-supporting endpoints, servers sometimes do not re-prompt
        for verification if the session recently passed UIA. For this endpoint, servers should always re-prompt
        the user for verification to ensure explicit consent is gained for each additional client.

        Servers are encouraged to apply stricter than normal rate limiting to this endpoint, such as maximum
        of 1 request per minute.

            The request was malformed, or the user does not have an ability to generate tokens for their devices,
            as implied by the [User-Interactive Authentication API](/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api).

            Clients should verify whether the user has an ability to call this endpoint with the `m.get_login_token`
            [capability](/client-server-api/#capabilities-negotiation).
