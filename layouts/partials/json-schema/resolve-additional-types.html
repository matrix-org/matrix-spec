{{/*

  Finds and returns all nested objects, given a dict containing:
   * `schema`: a JSON schema object
   * `anchor_base`: a prefix to add to the HTML anchors generated for each object. If nil, no anchors are generated.

  This template finds all nested objects inside `schema`.

  Assumes that "resolve-refs" and "resolve-allof" has already been called on the
  input schema.

  Returns an array of all the objects found. For each object, the following properties are returned:
    * title
    * properties
    * required
    * enum
    * anchor: a string suitable for using as an html anchor for this object (if `anchor_base` was set, and the object has a title)

  Note that the returned array may contain duplicate objects.
