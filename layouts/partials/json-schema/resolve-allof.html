{{/*

  Resolves the `allOf` keyword (https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#composition-and-inheritance-polymorphism)
  recursively, given a JSON schema object.

  `allOf` is used to support a kind of inheritance for JSON schema objects.

  An object can reference a "parent" object using `allOf`, and it then inherits
  its parent's properties. If the same property is present in the child, then
  we use the child's version (the child overrides the parent).

  Of course the parent can itself inherit from *its* parent, so we recurse to
  handle that.
