    This template is used to render an image representing a diagram.

    It takes the following parameters:

    * `name` (required): the file name without extension.
    * `alt` (required): a textual replacement for the image, useful for
      accessibility.
    
    Other requirements for diagrams:

    * They must be located in `/assets/diagrams`.
    * They must be WebP images, with a `.webp` file extension.
    * They must be rendered at a 200% scale. 

    Differences with loading a diagram as a regular markdown image:

    * The diagram is lazy-loaded, which should speed up the loading of the spec.
    * The dimensions of the diagram are added to the HTML, allowing the browser
      to pre-allocate space before it is loaded.
    * The diagram supports devices with high pixel density screens and a WebP
      image is generated for the default resolution.
    * A PNG fallback image is generated, for maximum browser compatibility.
