    This is a heading render hook (https://gohugo.io/render-hooks/headings/)
    using Docsy's heading self-links hook (https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/navigation/#heading-self-links).

    This is used when a heading is encountered in markdown content to generate
    the HTML for that heading. A self-link anchor is added at the end of the
    heading.
